# Bingo Dingo
This is the source code for the Bingo Dingo project. Bingo Dingo was designed from an inspiration of drinking games (yes I know I know...). You can use it for
various movies and games. There is also a seed mechanic, you can choose whether to play on a set seed or on a random seed. Bingo Dingo was designed to be mobile first.
